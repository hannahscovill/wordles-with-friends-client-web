Let's look at score history!

When a user finishes a game, they should see their game they just finished represented with emojis.

Lets explore some options, I think the game history page for a user should allow them to see all possible games with a "play now" button for that day or filter those out and just show the game history that exists for that user. there should be pagination.

persisted game behavior and retrieval is very wierd. I think it would be a good start to add game history. this should be a menu item in the avatar menu. this should take you to a page that shows the last 7 days dates and if you played a game for that date, your "score", represented as the colors of the board showing your guesses. you should be able to click on a date where you havent played a game for that date yet and play it. show the game date above the game board. make PRs in this repo if you need to. test locally with docker compose up in the scorekeeper repo and use playwright to test the behavior. include UI pictures commitited to the repo with your pr
